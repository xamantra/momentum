## Preview
In this image the process was like this:
- Open the app (Home Page).
- Go to *Add New List* page.
- Input some data.
- Close and Terminate on task view.
- Reopen the app again.

And magic happens! All the inputs were retained and not just that but also including the page where you left off. Navigation history is also persisted which means pressing the system back button will navigate you to the correct previous page.
